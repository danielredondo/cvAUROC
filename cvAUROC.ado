*Step 1: Set Seed by default for reproducibility

*Step 2: Divide data into `kfold' mutually exclusive subsets (default: 10)

set seed `seed'
xtile group = uniform() if `touse', nq(`kfold')

*Step 3: fit the model for each of the k-fold training sets

forvalues i = 1/`kfold' {
qui: logistic `var' if group!=`i' & `touse'

*Step 4: predict the outcome for each of the k-fold testing sets

display "`i'-fold.............................."
}

display "Random seed: `seed'" 

*Step 5: calculate the  AUC using the predicted probabilities for each fold

egen _fit = rowtotal(cv_fit*)
replace _fit = round(_fit,.001)
roctab `1' _fit if `touse', `detail' `graph'

*Step 6: Optinal table displaying the sensitivity, specificity and roc curve

*Step 7: drop variables created by program xvalAUC

drop group
//drop _fit
